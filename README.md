# The Next.js project that I would like to present is an interactive web application featuring a simple yet engaging game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. This project incorporates various components to enhance the user experience and provide additional functionalities.

The core feature of the project is the game itself, where users can play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer. The game follows the traditional rules, allowing players to select their move and see the outcome of each round. The application dynamically updates the scores and displays them in real-time, creating an immersive gaming experience.

Additionally, the project includes a table **leaderboard** that ranks the players based on their performance in the game. The leaderboard provides a sense of competition and encourages users to improve their gameplay. Players' names and scores are stored in a database, and the leaderboard is updated accordingly.

To enhance user engagement, the project implements a user registration and login system. Users can create their accounts, securely log in, and track their game statistics and progress over time. The registration and login functionalities ensure a personalized experience for each user, allowing them to save their game history and maintain their own profiles.

The project also features a profile page with **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations. Users can update their profile information, such as their name, profile picture, and other details. The profile page allows users to customize their experience and provides a central hub for managing their account settings.

To ensure a consistent and visually appealing layout across the entire application, the project includes a layout component comprising a footer and a navigation bar. This layout component wraps around all pages, providing a cohesive design and improving the overall aesthetics of the application.

The project is built using **Next.js**, a popular React framework that allows for server-side rendering, static site generation, and client-side rendering, providing optimal performance and SEO benefits. The application leverages Next.js's routing capabilities to navigate between different pages seamlessly.

**In summary, this Next.js project showcases an interactive game of Rock, Paper, Scissors, accompanied by a leaderboard for player rankings, a profile page with CRUD operations, and a layout component consisting of a footer and a navigation bar. The project combines engaging gameplay, user account management, and a visually appealing interface to create an enjoyable and immersive experience for users.**


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
